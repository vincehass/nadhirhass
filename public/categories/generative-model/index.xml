      <description>Introduction to Fraud detectionFraud detection is a set of processes and analyses that allow businesses to identify and prevent unauthorized financial activity. This can include fraudulent credit card transactions, identify theft, cyber hacking, insurance scams, and more. A fraud occurs when someone takes money or other assets from you through deception or criminal activity.
Consequently, having an effective fraud detection system can help institutions to identify suspicious behaviors or accounts and minimize losses if the fraud is ongoing.</description>
