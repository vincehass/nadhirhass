Thanks for stopping by!


My area of research focuses on probabilistic machine learning, deep learning and Reinforcement Learning for solving industrial optimization problems.

This can be achieved by combining large-scale distributed optimization and a variant of deep Q-Learning. Recent algorithms support for continuous action spaces makes it suitable for robotics problems and optimal control problem in industrial applications. A model is first trained offline and then deployed and fine-tuned on the real robot. 

I have worked on particular project with focus on approximate inference for neural networks and Bayesian optimization. These models allow to design algorithms that can incorporate prior knowledge, quantify uncertainty, and out-of-distribution detection for large data-set. Especially in the context of neural networks, these problems remain challenging.

<!-- I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. My research interests include applications of biomedical informatics in the public and population health fields. I work in the [Boland Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bolandlab/) on projects that develop novel data mining methods to extract pregnancy-related information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and study the relationship between environment and disease.
