Thanks for stopping by!


My area of research focuses on probabilistic machine learning, deep learning and Reinforcement Learning for solving real-world optimization problems.

This can be achieved by combining large-scale distributed optimization.Recent algorithms support for continuous action spaces makes it suitable for sequential data.

I have been working on particular project with focus on Generative modeling and diffusion processes. These models allow to design algorithms that can incorporate prior knowledge, quantify uncertainty, and out-of-distribution detection for large data-set. Especially in the context of deep learning, these problems remain challenging.

<!-- I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. My research interests include applications of biomedical informatics in the public and population health fields. I work in the [Boland Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bolandlab/) on projects that develop novel data mining methods to extract pregnancy-related information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and study the relationship between environment and disease.
