  I've been inspired by the increasing desire to efficiently tune machine learning hyper-parameters and make better generalization under distributional shifts. I am looking for rigorously analyse conventional and non-conventional assumptions inherent to Bayesian optimisation and approximate inference. Automating the process of choosing the best forecasting model and its corresponding parameters can result to improve a widerange of real-world applications.
